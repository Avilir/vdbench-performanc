# This scrips is design to run the vdbench test in container that create with the Ripsaw operator.
#
# It create file that contain the list of hosts which will use in the test, then it will run the
# configuration file created by the operator. when the benchmark run is finished, it will run the
# script that create excel report from the results, collect all outputs, logs and results into
# tar file.
